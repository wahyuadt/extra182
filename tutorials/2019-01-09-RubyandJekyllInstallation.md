### Step 2
Then, click the link in the first step to download the package (RubyInstaller Downloads)

### Step 3
Choose one of the first two links, depending on your computer's Windows system type (32-bit or 64-bit). If your system is 64-bit, then choose the first link. If your system is 32-bit, then choose the second link.
